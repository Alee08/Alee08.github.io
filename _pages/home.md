## About

My name is Alessandro Trapasso. I am a Research Fellow at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) ([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)). I earned my PhD in Artificial Intelligence from Sapienza University of Rome in September 2025.  
I worked with the research groups [RoCoCo Lab](http://labrococo.dis.uniroma1.it/) and [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/), and my supervisors were Prof. [Luca Iocchi](https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/iocchi/home) and Prof. [Fabio Patrizi](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//~patrizi/).

During my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), Barcelona, where I worked with Prof. [Anders Jonsson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson).

I earned my MSc and BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Sapienza University of Rome.  
Since 2022, I have been a licensed Professional Engineer in Italy.

My research interests are in Artificial Intelligence. I focus on integrating planning and learning, especially model-based reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems, with an emphasis on non-Markovian rewards (Reward Machines), concurrency, and coordination.

I also develop and maintain [Multi-Agent RLRM](https://github.com/Alee08/multiagent-rl-rm), an open-source Python framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with Reward Machines.  
In addition, I developed the multi-agent planning part in [Unified Planning](https://github.com/aiplan4eu/unified-planning).

I am passionate about Machine Learning, football, and chess.  
I believe curiosity and continuous self-improvement make a difference in any field where you want to excel.  
I am a positive person and I like to invest my time in what I love.
