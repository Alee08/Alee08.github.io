My name is Alessandro Trapasso. I am a [PhD Student](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ALESSANDRO-TRAPASSO_nP1597997_EN.aspx) in Artificial Intelligence at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) ([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)). 
I work with the research groups [RoCoCo Lab ](http://labrococo.dis.uniroma1.it/) and [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/), and my supervisors are Prof. [Luca Iocchi](https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/iocchi/home) and [Fabio Patrizi](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//~patrizi/).
I am doing a PhD visiting period at the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), Barcelona, and I am working with Prof. [Anders Jonnson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson).

I obtained an MSc. and BSc. in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.
From 2022, I am a qualified Professional Engineer in Italy.

My research interests are in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I'm interested in integrating planning and learning, especially using a Model-based RL approach in multi-agent systems.

I have a great passion for Machine Learning, football and chess.
I think having passion and curiosity, wanting to improve yourself to become a better version of yourself, makes a difference in every field where you want to excel. 
I am a positive person and like to invest my time doing what I love.
