My name is Alessandro Trapasso.
I have an MSc and BSc degree in Engineering in Computer Science obtained at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) ([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)).
I have a great passion for Machine Learning, football and chess.
I am convinced that passion, the desire to improve, to become an even better version of oneself,
added to excellent skills, make the difference in every field in which you want to excel.
I am a positive person and like to invest my time doing what I love.
