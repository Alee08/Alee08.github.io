My name is Alessandro Trapasso. I am a [PhD Student](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ALESSANDRO-TRAPASSO_nP1597997_EN.aspx) in Artificial Intelligence at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) ([DIAG](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)). 
I work with the research groups [RoCoCo Lab ](http://labrococo.dis.uniroma1.it/) and [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/), and my supervisor is prof. [Luca Iocchi](https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/iocchi/home).

I have an MSc. and BSc. in Engineering in Computer Science obtained at Sapienza University of Rome.

I have a great passion for Machine Learning, football and chess.
I think having passion and curiosity, wanting to improve yourself to become a better version of yourself, makes a difference in every field where you want to excel. 
I am a positive person and like to invest my time doing what I love.
